# PyCaret and Streamlit Project (Diadetect)

This is a project that demonstrates how to use PyCaret and Streamlit to build and deploy a data app. PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web app that allows users to explore and analyze a dataset, select and train a machine learning model, and generate predictions. The app uses PyCaret to perform data preprocessing, model selection, model tuning, and model evaluation. The app also uses Streamlit to create an interactive user interface and display the results.

The dataset used in this project is the diabetes dataset, which contains information about patients with diabetes, such as their age, sex, blood pressure, glucose level, insulin level, body mass index, and outcome. The dataset can be used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their features.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher and the following packages installed:

- PyCaret
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy

You can install the packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pycaret streamlit pandas numpy
```

To run the app locally, you need to clone this repository and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the app in your browser. You can then use the sidebar to navigate through the app and interact with the data and the model. You can also upload your own data and make predictions using the app.

To access the app online, you can visit the link of the deployed app: [https://diabete-app.onrender.com]. This app is hosted on Render, a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy web apps and services.

Note that due to the fact the app is deployed on a free server it may take some time to load (The username : nanji , password : abcd)

## App Images

I will be adding some images of the app on the README soon. They will show how the app looks and works. Stay tuned!
